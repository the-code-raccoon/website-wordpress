            The first time I ever picked up the proverbial coding pen I was 11
            years old at a 'Girls Who Code' workshop happening at my middle
            school - and the rest was history. After a few years at the
            University of Toronto's Computer Science program, the area I found I
            was lacking the most was practical, hands-on skills. I decided to
            attended a short yet intensive full-stack web development bootcamp
            at Lighthouse Labs. After such a hands-on experience, I am more sure
            than ever that coding and web development is where my future lies.
